Operation: Select and edit

In CSS we use selectors
	Types: 

    1) Element selector: uses the tag.
	<p> </p> -> p {	}

    2) Class selector: to specific items 
	<p class="aclass"> </p> -> .aclass { }
	- to several items (h1, p...)
	- dot is used as prefix

    3) Id selector:
	<p id="sometext"> </p> -> #sometext { }
	- octothorp

How to link a CSS file to a HTML one
	- In <head> </head> : 

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/style.css">


Specificity: the more specific selector overrides other 
	inline-style > id > class > element

    <h2 class="about-me" id="me-about" style="color: steelblue;">

What are the differences between class and id?
	- As seem, id is more specific.
	CLASS: to be used multiple times
	ID: despite working if set in more than one object, the convention is to use once.

Pseudoselectors
	- Used after a colon (:)
	- Don't let space
    h2:hover {
		/*properties if pointer is over the selector's object and this is the most specific*/ 
    }

    ul:first-child { } does not work
    li:first-child {
	color: blue;
    } /*works. It's the first list item*/

		first-child, last-child, nth-child(n), only-child (does not apply to multiple children)


More pseudoselectors
	link is unvisited link
	visited's default color: purple

    <a href="https://google.com" id="google-link">Clique aqui para ir ao Google!</a>
	- You need to put https to create a web link
	- The id is dispensable because it's the only link on page

    #google-link:link {		/*before clicking*/
	color: green;
    }

    #google-link:visited {
	color: red;
    }
